## Halite-I

Contestants write bots to play an original multi-player turn-based strategy game played on a rectangular grid.

Bots fight for control of a 2D grid. The bot with the most territory at the end wins. Victory will require micromanaging of the movement of your pieces, optimizing your bot's combat ability, and braving a branching factor billions of times higher than that of Go.

## Halite-II
In this version players competed for control of planets using ships in space.

 Your mission is to extract Halite. Bots control ships that dock on and mine planets, producing more ships to defeat opponents. To achieve victory, you will need optimal pathfinding and swarm control to move efficiently from planet to planet and destroy enemy ships.
